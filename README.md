# Liri Node App

Liri--it's like Siri, only better!

This app uses Node.js to pull data from Twitter, Spotify and the Online Movie Database. 

Play around with it to check out my last 20 tweets, research movies and see song info. 

There's also a hidden .env file that holds my api key data, so sorry, you can't see that.
